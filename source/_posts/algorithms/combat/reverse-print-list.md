## Question

There is a single linkedlist that prints out the values of each node from end to head.

## Thought

I don't think it's a difficult problem, we just need use a stack, store the values and print them.
We do like this:

We got a list and a stack.

![Step1](https://sherlockblaze.com/resources/img/cs/reverse_print_list/step1.png)

We push the values of list into the stack one by one.

![Step2](https://sherlockblaze.com/resources/img/cs/reverse_print_list/step2.png)

And we already know about how stack works. If you don't know about it clearly, go [here](../../../data_structures/doc/lists/Stack.md#Stack) to read more.

![Step3](https://sherlockblaze.com/resources/img/cs/reverse_print_list/step3.png)

At the last, we can get result by popping the elements from the stack.

## Code

We use the [linkedlist](https://sherlockblaze.com/2019/01/21/computer_science/data_structures/LinkedList/) and [stack](https://sherlockblaze.com/2019/01/21/computer_science/data_structures/Stack/) implemented before to implement it. Just read the code:

```c
