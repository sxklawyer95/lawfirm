- The first lever is your knowledge of the best practices. In other words, the good 'technical rules' that enhance concentration (like good organization, good preparation, good stress management, etc.)
- The second lever is your _natural ability to concentrate._

So the second part of the book is **[dedicated](#dedicated)** to the first lever: the best practices. You will discover the most efficient practices and rules to improve **[drastically](#drastic)** your concentration.

All of these best practices have been developed by the world top Doctors and Experts in personal **[efficiency](#efficiency)**, to ensure you the highest quality of information.

More than that, it can be widely improved by using some **[jealously](#jealous)** kept techniques or disclosed only to a few **[privileged](#privileged)** people.

The Doctor Vittoz secret concentration technique is one of them, and was widely used by one of the most important contributor to humanity: Albert Einstein.

This technique will improve your memory in all fields, and the results you will get may change your life.

Like Einstein himself said he saw the results: "The Vittoz will **[revolutionize](#revolutionize)** the World."
