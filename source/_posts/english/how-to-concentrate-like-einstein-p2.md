## Part 1- A New Beginning In Life With Einstein's Secret

### Content

#### a- Concentration: the Key to Success

***"[Wealthy](#wealthy) men and women are noted for their power of concentration", Don King.***

Concentration is the great secret of power and success. Studies have **[revealed](#relealed)** this surprising fact: on a sample of people who succeed in their life (success in the broad sense, that is they reached a goal they set for themselves, whether it is to become rich, to **[ace](#ace)** a difficult exam or to be successful at a certain skill, etc.), ALL had incredible focus ability. Their particularity was that in any condition, even most difficult (**[ambient](#ambient)** noise, stressful situations, limited **[furniture](#funiture)** or financial resources etc.), these people remained fully concentrated.

But let's have a close look on what concentration really means.

The Merriam-Webster defines the action of concentrating as ***"a directing of the attention or of the mental [faculties](#faculty) toward a single object"***.

So, concentration gives you the power to both:

1. achieve a specific goal in your life
2. _fully concentrate on what you want as long as you want._

**Achieve a specific goal in your life**

You may ask yourself:

"Why so many people are not able to achieve goals that really count for them?".

The reason is because they are not able to **[remain](#remain)** exclusively focused on their goals enough time.

Indeed, 97% of the people almost always **[drift](#drift)** from their goal day after day, because they start thinking at early stage about a back-up plan.. just in case that something fails!

In other words, they are **[adopting](#adopt)** one of the most common and efficient way to fail: they are **[unconsciously](#unconsciously)** **[anticipating](#anticipating)** failure by "putting their eggs in several baskets".

On the **[contrary](#contrary)**, successful people can **[demonstrate](#demonstrate)** enough concentration power to dedicate themselves to the **[attainment](#attainment)** of their goal with an **[unswerving](#unswerving)** singleness of purpose.

They know how to keep the main thing the main thing, no matter the goal they want to achieve nor the amount of time they set for it (a day, a month, a year...).

As Andrew Carnegie said: "put all your eggs in one basket and watch the basket".

Being able to concentrate exclusively and enough time on the goal you want to achieve is the only way that will lead you to success.

**Fully concentrate on what you want as long as you want.**

This point is about concentration applied to short durations -from several minutes up to several hours-.

That's why this point is generally fascinating for students (High-School, College or University students) because it directly concerns lectures, study time and... success at exams!

Indeed, a good concentration gives a student the power to both reduce his study time by 3 or more AND import significantly his grades at the same time. (This book will **[reveal](#reveal)** you **[precisely](#precisely)** how to do this).

Here are the reasons of what is claimed here:

_Why a good concentration can reduce your study time by 3 or more:_

First, because a high concentration state will allow you to get rid of distractions during your study time and to stay exclusively focused on the content of your study.

Thus, you will be able to resize your study-time **[slots](#slots)** and make them shorter, because they will be free from these time-wasting moments of distraction.

Second, because good concentration automatically triggers good memorization. Which means the more concentrated you are during a lecture, the more information you will memorize, and the less study time you will need because you won't have to memorize this information again.

Believe it or not, but anyone who has a 100% locked-in attention during a lecture is able to **[restitute](#restitute)** at least 87% of the lecture in details.

So, there's a lot to bet that very soon, your actual study-time **[slots](#slots)** will become oversized, as if you were in a shirt really large for you.

_Why concentration can improve your grades:_

During an exam or an **[admission](#admission)** test, you need to make the most of every minute because a 1/4 of points can make all the difference between you and another student.

That's why having a high concentration level is crucial, because you can't afford losing a single minute dreaming or thinking about something with absolutely no link with your exam.

**[Moreover](#moreover)**, a high concentration increases drastically the speed of your thinking process: you are able to recall an information or to do a calculation at least twice faster than if your mind is constantly interrupted.

Thus, your performance **[soars](#soar)** and you automatically increase your chances to get better grades and to have an advantage over others in an **[entrance](#entrance)** exam.

#### b- Examples of Successful People with Incredible Focus Ability

- **Albert Einstein** in naturally one of them.

> His concentration ability led him to become one of the most fascinating and influential figures of the modern **[era](#era)** with his unique contribution to modern physics.

- **Napoleon** had naturally an extraordinary high degree of concentration.

> He could jump with the greatest **[ease](#ease)** from one work to another, without being disturbed by his previous work and completely mid-free to start the next one.
>
> His day finished, he could sleep very soundly at night even **[amidst](#amidst)** busy war, and wake up a few hours later with the same **[immediacy](#immediacy)** and completely rested.
>
> Napoleon's power of concentration was so **[enormous](#enormous)** that he impressed people with the quality of his memory for detail and facts.
>
> Indeed, it is argued that when on **[campaign](#campaign)** in 1805 one of his subordinates could not locate his **[division](#division)**.
>
> While his aids searched through maps and papers, the Emperor informed the officer of his unit's present location, where he would be for the next three nights, the status and resume of the units strength as well as the subordinates **[military](#military)** record.
>
> This out of an army with seven **[corps](#corps)**, a total of 200,000 men, with all the units on the move.

- **Beethoven** was twenty years old when he became deaf.

> Yet, he wrote only **[splendid](#splendid)** compositions because his deafness gave him the power of total concentration and the ability to hear his music in his own mind.

At the capture of Syracuse by the Romans, **Archimede** was drawing up on the ground a defense plan to protect the city.

He was so concentrated on his drawing that, even with the **[chaos](#chaos)** that **[reigned](#reigned)** in the city and the **[cries](#cries)** of **[distress](#distress)** of his **[fellow-citizens](#fellow-citizens)**, he didn't notice the **[averse](#averse)** army forces a few steps behind him.

He was killed by an enemy without even seeing him.

#### c- The Lazy Student's Golden Concentration Formula

As specified previously, concentration can be defined by the following **[formula](#formula)**:

**$CONCENTRATION = BP x (NAC)^2$**

**BP** stands for '**Best Practices**'

**NAC** stands for '**Natural Ability to Concentrate**'

This means that your concentration directly depends on the 'Best Practices' (BP) to apply and your Natural Ability to Concentrate (NAC).

So, just let the Best Practices of this book guide you and the Doctor Vittoz secret technique activate your **[untapped](#untapped)** concentration ability, and watch a **[miracle](#miracle)** happen in your life!
