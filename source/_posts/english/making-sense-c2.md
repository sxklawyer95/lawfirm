## Second steps: the big picture

### Content

Children take their next **[tentative](#tentative)** steps along the grammar road at around eighteen months. They are becoming more active and curious. There is a whole new world to discover. Adults are beginning to talk to them about it. And they want to talk back.

During the first year of life most of the interaction between adult and child is playful. **[Engaging](#engage)** in a game of peep-bo or round-and-round-the garden is great fun, but it's hardly a conversation. During the second year, however, the language becomes more serious, with explanations ('That's not a teddy, it's an elephants'), descriptions ('I can see a big red bus'), and warnings (Don't touch that tap - it's hot). To **[adopt](#adopt)** an Internet expression: the speech directed to the child now has more content. Adults also start to **[amplify](#amplify)** what **[toddlers](#toddler)** are saying by **[expanding](#expand)** their holophrases - in effect, showing them how to say more complex thing. 'Dog,' says the child. 'Yes, he's a nice dog,' says the adult.And sooner or later, the child will have a go at the more advanced sentence: 'Big dog.'

What all this interaction does is present the child with example after example of everyday sentences. The utterances are short and to the point. Adults seem to know **[instinctively](#instinctively)** just how long to make them. Nobody ever responds to 'Dog' by saying, 'Yes, he's a lovely big dog who barks a lot and who likes to run round the garden chasing a ball.' The result is that children at this age repeatedly hear a set of basic sentence patterns, spoken with a similar rhythm and melody. So it's no surprise that, once they are capable of listening, remembering, and **[articulating](#articulate)** longer sequences of words, these patterns are going to be the ones that **[characterize](#characterize)** their first **[attempts](#attempt)** at more **[mature](#mature)** sentences.

The period from around eighteen months to two is often called the 'two-word stage', for obvious reasons when we look at this selection of typical sentences. They're all from a child, Victoria, aged twenty-one months:

> baby cry        daddy gone       dolly there        gone milk
> she drink       drink dolly      it off             that horsie

What's remarkable is that these sentences show she has already mastered the basic principle of grammar: when words com together in a sentence, they perform different roles. We can get a sense of what these roles are if we **[interpret](#interpret)** what she's saying in adult terms, starting with there five:

> baby cry                       the baby / is crying
> daddy gone                     daddy / has just gone
> dolly there                    dolly / is there
> gone milk = milk gone          the milk / has just gone
> drink dolly = dolly drink      dolly / is drinking

In each sentence she introduces a topic - the name of a someone or a something - building on her earlier ability to name people or objects. Then she says something about it - usually what is happening to it or has just happened to it. In two cases, the action is going on; in two cases, the action is over; and in one case she's reporting location (there). It's as if she's getting to **[grips](#grip)** with the big picture - **[sketching](#sketch)** out a **[narrative](#narrative)** in the **[broadest](#broadest)** terms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that she's **[aware](#aware)** of these roles even when she gets the word order wrong. In English, when you're making a statement, the doer goes before the doing. (It would be the other way round in some languages, such as Welsh.) She knows very well that it's the dolly doing the drinking. And if that's so (I imagine her reasoning), then the meaning will come across whatever order the words come out in. Which it does, in this case. It'll be a while before she realizes that changing the word order can change the meaning: _daddy push_ is different from _push daddy_.

Grammarians call the names _nouns_ and the actions _verbs_. Old grammars would talk about a noun being 'the name of a person, place or thing' - a good start, but not a **[satisfactory](#satisfactory)** definition, as there are lots of nouns that are none of these, such as those that refer to abstract notions (_[conscience](#conscience)_ politics, happiness... ). These grammars would also define verbs as 'doing words' - again, an **[unsatisfactory](unsatisfactory)** definition, as there are many verbs that don't 'do' anything (is, see, feel...). But these definitions do at least capture the way Victoria is thinking of words at this age. She seems to have **[grasped](grasp)** the principle that words do different jobs in a sentence - and, one **[far-off](#far-off)** day, when in school she starts learning about how to describe the grammar she already speaks, she will find out that these words belong to different 'word classes', traditionally called 'parts of speech'.

Her other sentences show that her **[rudimentary](#rudimentary)** ideas about grammar aren't **[restricted](restrict)** to nouns and verbs. She already knows that there are words (such as _she_, _it_, and _that_) which save you the bother of having to name something a second time.

> she drink        instead of       dolly drink

In school, she'll learn to call these words **[pronouns](#pronouns)**. And her early two-word sentences show some other grammatical notions emerging too - but more on that in Chapter 3.

**Keywords: subject and [predicate](#predicate)**

Victoria's insight about the big picture - that sentences can have two parts, each part performing a different role - was also one of the first grammatical insights of the early Greek writers on language. Plato in his **[Sophist](#sophist)** (261-2, Harold Flowler's translation) has his Stranger introduce the subject to Theaetetus: 'let us now **[investigate](#investigate)** names', and the **[dialogue](#dialogue)** continues:

> Stranger: ... we have two kinds of **[vocal](#vocal) [indications](#indication)** of being.
> Theaetetus: How so?
> Stranger: One called nouns(_[onomata](#onoma)_), the other verbs(_[rhemata](#rhema)_).
> Theaetetus: Define each of them.
> Stranger: The **[indication](#indication)** which relates to action we may call a verb.
> Theaetetus: Yes.
> Stranger: And the **[vocal](#vocal)** sign applied to those who perform the actions in question we can call a noun.
> Theaetetus: Exactly.
> Stranger: **[Hence](#hence) [discourse](#discourse)** is never **[composed](#compose)** of nouns alone spoken in succession, nor of verbs spoken without nouns.

To which Theaetetus, perhaps anticipating the twenty-first century, replies:

> Theaetetus: I do not understand that.

and gets a **[slap](#slap)** on the **[wrist](#wrist)** for not paying attention:

> Stranger: I see; you **[evidently](#evident)** had something else in mind when you **[assented](#assent)** just now; for what I wished to say was just this, that verbs and nouns do not make **[discourse](#discourse)** if spoken successively in this way.

But Plato seems to sense that his readers do need an example.

> Theaetetus: In what way?
> Stranger: For instance, 'walks', 'runs', 'sleeps', and the other verbs which **[denote](#denote)** actions, even if you utter all there are of them in succession, do not make **[discourse](#discourse)** for all that.
> Theaetetus: No, of course not.
> Stranger: And again, when 'lion', 'stag', 'horse', and all other names of those who perform these actions are uttered, such a succession of words does not yet make **[discourse](#discourse)**; for in neither case do the words uttered indicate action or inaction or existence of anything that exists or does not exist, until the verbs are **[mingled](#mingle)** with the nouns; then the words fit, and their first combination is a sentence, about the first and shortest form of **[discourse](#discourse)**.

The verbs have to be **[mingled](#mingle)** with the nouns. The Stranger has, in effect, anticipated the distinction between the one-word and two-word stages of development in language acquisition. The words in isolation don't 'make a **[discourse](#discourse)**'. Only by combining them do we make sense.

Translators face a problem with the two critical terms:

_[rhema](#rhema)_ - the name of an action (plural _[rhemata](#rhema)_)
_[onoma](#onoma)_ - the name of the one who performs the action (plural _[onomata](#onoma)_)

To translate them as 'verb' and 'noun' is as near as we can get, using modern **[terminology](#terminology)**, but Plato's distinction was based on the meaning of the two parts, and on the way they worked in sentences to express logical relationships. They aren't 'parts of speech', for that kind of classification of words into classes came later (see Chapter 6).

It took a while for modern grammatical **[terminology](#terminology)** to develop. **[Eventually](#Eventually)**, 'the one who performs the action' came to be called the _subject_ of the sentence - a natural development of the general meaning of this word - 'subject matter'. Everything else in the sentence was called the _[predicate](#predicate)_ - less obvious usage, unless you were familiar with the terms used in logic. So, the sentence _my uncle saw the doctor_ would be analysed like this:

> My uncle / saw the doctor.
> SUBJECT    **[PREDICATE](#predicate)**

That all seems straightforward enough, but in grammar things are never entirely straightforward. This is the Great Truth about grammar: it is an art as well as a science, and it is always possible to analyse sentences in more a science, and it is always possible to analyse sentences in more than one way. Especially when the concepts and terms devised for one language come to be used for another - as here, Greek into English via Latin - there is likely to be scope fo different interpretations.

Nobody disagreed about what a subject was. But there were two main differences of opinion about predicates. The first we can see if we look at the kind of sentence used in studies of logic:

> My uncle is a doctor.

Logicians would say that _a doctor_ is the **[predicate](predicate)** - that which is said of the subject. They would ignore the verb _is_, as they saw its function to be simply a way of linking the subject to the **[predicate](#predicate)**. They called this verb the _[copula](#copula)_ (from a Latin word meaning 'fasten together' - and yes, it is the same root as in _[copulate](copula)_). If the job of the **[copula](#copula)** was to link the two parts of the sentence, then it couldn't be part of either.

This is how the term _[predicate](#predicate)_ was used when it arrived in English in the fifteenth century as part of the study of logic. But a century later, when grammarians began to analyse English sentences, a problem arose:

- Some continued to think that the **[copula](#copula)** wasn't part of the **[predicate](#predicate)**, on the grounds, that it had no meaning. They seemed to think of the sentence as if it were 'my uncle - doctor'. This wouldn't be grammatical in English (though it would in Russian), but it expresses the same meaning.
- Other disagreed. They thought the **[copula](#copula)** _was_ part of the **[predicate](#predicate)**, on the grounds that it was a verb, acting like any other verb - for example, able to change its **[tense](#tense)**:

A. My uncle / knows a doctor. My uncle / knew a doctor.
B. My uncle /is a doctor.     My uncle / was a doctor.

If the subject/**[predicate](#predicate)** division is made after the word _uncle_ in the A pair of sentences, it was argued, why not in the B pair? This is the way these sentences are usually analysed nowadays, but the question of where to start the **[predicate](#predicate)** caused a lot of heart-searching among early grammarians of English.

That wasn't the only issue. What to do with longer sentences like this one?

> My uncle saw the doctor yesterday in London.

The question here was what to do with the extra bits. _Yesterday_ and _in London_ could be **[omitted](omit)** from the sentence and the sentence would still make sense. Grammarians began to call them _[adjuncts](#adjunct)_ (from a Latin word meaning 'associated' or 'relevant'). So, how should a grammarian deal with **[adjuncts](#adjunct)**? Were they part of the **[predicate](#predicate)** or not? Once again, there were two options.

- Some thought the **[adjuncts](#adjunct)** were part of the **[predicate](#predicate)**, on the grounds that their job was to **[amplify](#amplify)** the meaning of the verb - when did the action of seeing take place? Where did it take place? They would analyse the sentence like this:

> My uncle / saw the doctor yesterday in London/
> SUBJECT    Predicate

Just as adjectives say more about nouns, they argued - as in _young doctor_ - so **[adjuncts](#adjunct)** say more about verbs - _see yesterday_.

- Other disagreed. They thought **[adjuncts](#adjunct)** shouldn't be part of the **[predicate](#predicate)**, on the grounds that they weren't **[essential](#essential)** to the core meaning of what's being said - that an uncle is seeing a doctor, regardless of when or where. So they would analyse the sentence like this:

> My uncle / saw the doctor / yesterday in London.
> SUBJECT    **[Predicate](#predicate)**        **[Adjunct](#adjunct)**

You'll find both these views represented in grammar books today - as well as a third: that it's better to avoid the term _[predicate](#predicate)_ altogether, on the grounds that it's too broad a notion. There are so many kinds of construction in English that can be grouped under the heading of **[predicate](#predicate)** - this view argues - that it makes more sense to study these constructions directly. I'll take about what these are in Chapter 8, but it's worth noting now that, despite its long history in English language study, some grammars today don't mention the word _[predicate](#predicate)_ at all.

Now, if you're already asking 'but which of these different views is correct?' you're not thinking like a modern grammarian. The point is that there's a good reason to support each analysis; and what makes grammar interesting - at least, to grammarians - is **[evaluating](evaluate)** the arguments that support one view rather than another. Some of these arguments are scientific in character, based on an assessment of the consequences that follow from taking a particular view. But - and this is the point that's often forgotten - some are **[aesthetic](#aesthetic)** arguments: one analysis is thought to be 'simpler' or 'more satisfying' or 'more **[elegant](#elegant)**' than another. This isn't an issue found only in grammar, of course. Biologist Peter Medawar called his influential **[philosophical](#philosophicl)** account of scientific method _The Art of the [Soluble](#soluble)(1968)_.

It's this insight that is often forgotten by those in **[ministries](#ministry)** of education around the world who think that grammar can be tested in the same way as spelling or mathematics. Schools have to teach a standard, of course, and children have to learn that standard, if their spoken and written usage is to live up to the expectations of society. Testing is a way of trying to make that happen. But it should never be forgotten that the usages that make up this standard, and the ways in which these are analysed and described, **[comprise](#comprise)** a selection from a set of practices and opinions that are at times **[diverse](#diverse)**. The challenge, as I'll discuss in Chapter 25, is to find ways of testing grammar that either avoid the **[diversity](#diversity)** or, better, build it into the educational system.
